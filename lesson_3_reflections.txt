When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It depends if you are done with your project or got far enough and want to share it, save it, host it, or keep it private.
You can also have other people work on the project. They can give feedback and suggestions which you can later add to your
project if you wanted to.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you would want to pull changes manually becasue if more than one user is editing or working on the same project you would want to make sure the commits your pulling are something you would need on your final project. Automaticcally staying up-to-date with your remote repository would mean more possible unnecessary commits that have not been approved or might not need or want in your final project.
